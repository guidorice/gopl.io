Create a web server that queries github.com once then allows the navigation of
the list of bug reports, milestones, and users, starting with a github
organization at the root level. Note: ex 4.14 is in the chapter "text and html
templates" so this exercise focuses on server-side rendering of html, rather
than client side javascript rendering and using a json rest api.
